### Learning outcomes
* interact with a DOM (document object model)
* listen to events in a browser
* send requests to fetch data

### Todo
* A small website that allows you to add food items
* Also a tool to automatically transpile TS into JS, and also compile CSS and HTML files
    * A frontend framework like Next.js should have this functionality built in.
